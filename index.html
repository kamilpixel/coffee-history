                  According to legend, coffee was discovered by an Ethiopian
                  goat herder named Kaldi, who noticed his goats becoming
                  energetic after eating red berries from a shrub. Monks later
                  used these berries to stay awake during long prayers — marking
                  the first recorded use of coffee as a stimulant

                  Coffee cultivation began in Yemen, and by the 1400s it was
                  widely consumed in Sufi monasteries to sustain night-long
                  devotions. The port city of Mocha became the world's first
                  major coffee trade hub. Coffeehouses — known as qahveh khaneh
                  — emerged in Mecca and Constantinople, serving as centers for
                  social and intellectual gatherings

                  When coffee arrived in Europe through Venetian traders, it was initially controversial — some clergy called it "the bitter invention of Satan."
