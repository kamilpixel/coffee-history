                  According to legend, coffee was discovered by an Ethiopian
                  goat herder named Kaldi, who noticed his goats becoming
                  energetic after eating red berries from a shrub. Monks later
                  used these berries to stay awake during long prayers — marking
                  the first recorded use of coffee as a stimulant

                  Coffee cultivation began in Yemen, and by the 1400s it was
                  widely consumed in Sufi monasteries to sustain night-long
                  devotions. The port city of Mocha became the world's first
                  major coffee trade hub. Coffeehouses — known as qahveh khaneh
                  — emerged in Mecca and Constantinople, serving as centers for
                  social and intellectual gatherings

                  When coffee arrived in Europe through Venetian traders, it was
                  initially controversial — some clergy called it "the bitter
                  invention of Satan." But Pope Clement VIII approved it after
                  tasting it. Soon, coffeehouses flourished in London, Paris,
                  and Vienna, becoming known as "Penny Universities" for the
                  conversations and debates they hosted

                  European colonists introduced coffee to the Caribbean, South
